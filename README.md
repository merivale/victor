A model of the English language, thought of as a code for processing *messages* (structured arrangements of informational choices) into *sentences* (strings of words), inspired by the work of grammarian and logician Victor Howard Dudman.

To play around with the model, and to read more about the theory and its philosophical contexts, see [www.merivale.uk/victor/](http://www.merivale.uk/victor/).
