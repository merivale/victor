# Victor / src / Interface

This directory contains the code necessary for getting the application up and running, and generating the HTML for the user interface. There is nothing here of theoretical interest concerning my model of English, but feel free to have a look around if you wish. Otherwise, I encourage you to head over to [the README in the `src/Theory` directory](https://github.com/merivale/victor/tree/master/src/Theory), and examine the source code there.

For exposition purposes, the model is divided into four layers of increasing complexity (and a fifth layer representing the full theory). Each of these is wrapped up in its own Elm app: `Plain.elm`, `Short.elm`, `Long.elm`, `Object.elm`, and `Victor.elm`.
