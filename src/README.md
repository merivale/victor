My algorithm is written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), with the styles written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/). The compiled HTML+JS+CSS is stored in the `docs` folder, for easy integration with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source code is divided into two subdirectories, `Interface` and `Theory`. The former directory contains all the modules responsible for generating the web page users see, for keeping track of user input, and for piecing that input together into a message variable. It is the modules in the latter directory that are potentially of theoretical interest, since they describe what a message variable looks like, and define the encoding function that converts these variables into strings.
